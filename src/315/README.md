# 329. [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]
```

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
